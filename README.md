# Secret: Secure Password Management and File Storage

## Introduction
Secret is a user-friendly desktop application designed for secure password management and encrypted file storage. Utilizing robust encryption and hashing techniques, Secret ensures data protection from unauthorized access.

## Purpose
Secret provides a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) empowering users to securely store, manage, and access their passwords and files. It offers features like password generation, record management, search and filtering capabilities, and auto backup.

## Definitions
- **Password Database File:** Contains essential information for each password record, encrypted with a master password.
- **Encryption:** Process of transforming data into an unreadable form using a secret key.
- **Encrypted Container File:** Stores encrypted files within, accessible through a password.
- **Password Generator:** Produces random passwords with specified characteristics, displaying their strength.
- **Auto Backup:** Automatically saves recent changes in password database files to prevent data loss.
- **Entropy Measure:** Quantifies password unpredictability based on character combinations.

## Goals and Objectives
The overarching goal is to offer a secure and user-friendly solution for password and file management. Objectives include:
- Design and implementation of a user-friendly GUI supporting Secret's functionalities.
- Integration of encryption algorithms ensuring confidentiality and integrity of data.
- Implementation of robust password generation and search/filtering features.
- Auto backup functionality to safeguard against accidental data loss.
- Adherence to standard security practices including input validation and error handling.
- Comprehensive documentation covering requirements, design, implementation, and testing.

## Plan
Secret follows an incremental development approach, dividing the project into manageable increments and delivering them in cycles. Each cycle comprises:
- **Requirements Analysis:** Defining functional and non-functional requirements for each increment.
- **Design:** Crafting system and application architectures for each increment.
- **Implementation:** Writing Python code using test-driven development (TDD) approach, ensuring code functionality through rigorous testing.
- **Testing:** Thoroughly testing the code using various techniques and fixing any bugs or errors.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing code against requirements and design, incorporating feedback into subsequent cycles.
